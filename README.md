# SciHive 

Read, collaborate and talk about scientific papers

## Run SchiHive locally
The front-end of SciHive is written as a React application.  
To run this application on your local machine, you will need to have **npm** version 5.6+ with **Node.js** version 8.10+.  
Once these are installed go into your cloned repository and run the command `npm start`.  
This will start up the application; _however_, it will only load the website if the back-end code is running.
The back-end code can be found [here](https://github.com/ranihorev/scihive-backend).
